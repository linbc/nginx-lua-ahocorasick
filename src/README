------------------------

This folder contain the implementation of Aho-Corasick Pattern Searching Algorithm.


The Ahoâ€“Corasick string matching algorithm is a string searching algorithm invented by 
Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick. It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that 
locates elements of a finite set of strings (the "dictionary") within an input text. 
It matches all patterns simultaneously.
